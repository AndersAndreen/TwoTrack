# Enclose vs Select vs Do

Most operations using TwoTrack involves the three commands ´Enclose´, ´Select´ and ´Do´. What are the differences, and when does one of them fit better than the other? Just ask yourself three questions:

1. Do I want to keep all the current values and add yet another value? [Choose ´Enclose´](./Enclose.md)!  
2. Do I want to transform the current value(s) into new value(s) or discard of some values no longer needed? [Choose ´Select´](./Select.md)!  
3. Transform or combine the current values into new values or discard of some values no longer needed? [Choose ´Do´](./Do.md)!
